// Ternary Operator

//If a customer has more than 100 points
// they are a 'gold' customer, other wise
// the are a 'silver' customer

let points = 100
let type = points > 100 ? 'gold' : 'silver';  // the '>' makes this a boolean true or false opererand but adding the '?' makes it the ternary   add the true then this.  could use '>=' to make it equal too


console.log(type);  // reuslt: gold if over 100
